Ainsi, toutes nos remarques concernant l'ergonomie, la qualité de l'écran, le confort d'utilisation et même dans une certaine mesure, l'efficacité de la ventilation peuvent tout à fait être adaptées à tous les ressortissants de la gamme. Nous ne nous étendrons en revanche pas sur les performances. Pas la peine de vous faire rêver (ou cauchemarder) en vain. Sachez toutefois que si d'aventure, le Y740-17lRHg (81UJ001CFR) devait un jour pointer le bout de son clavier sur les étagères, il serait, selon Lenovo, commercialisé aux alentours de 3600 euros.",
